# chat-app
project entitled for mesaging platform

current notes:

Goal: Building a live chat server with rust and socket.io
Problem: Need to understand warp, socket.io, http requests.
Strategy: Documentation for warp, socket.io, http requests. 

Dependencies for warp framework have been added
Futures are abstractions for asynchronous programming.
serde_json helps parse the unserialized data and reads them into serialized data to then user
Tokio is key for it’s runtime ability for asynchronous programming 
Warp is a framework designed to help with containing these server-client implementations
